## Resources
This list will be updated on a regular basis.

### Basics
- I found [this course](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) to be very good in explaining the fundamentals of machine learning.
Additional material, like homework and solutions can be found on the site as well.
This course has a total of 18 lectures and is intended to take you about 10 weeks to finish.
One little note: Some parts are very mathematical because the professor proves that machine learning is possible.
- [A collection](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch) of popular ML algorithms implemented in python. It's quite a good resource to see whats going on there. Also python shouldn't be too hard to read if you are familiar with javascript, so don't let that scare you!

### Reinforcement Learning
- [Introductory Post](https://deeplearning4j.org/reinforcementlearning.html) the title says 'for Java', but don't let that scare you, it's not about actual code.

### R
- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is a learning platform that offers interactive tutorials for data related coding (basically python and R). For most courses you have to pay but [this introduction course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) is for free.
